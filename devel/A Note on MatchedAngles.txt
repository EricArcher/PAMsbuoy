Matched Angles doesn't decide if all matched angles meet at the same spot,
only if each one intersects (roughly). Proof is in IDs 96-103 in this DB.
96-99 and 100-103 are 1 call each from the buoys. The first set are all taken
from actual calls, so they should all point to the same place. The second set
has Buoy 2 pointing at white noise - DIFARBearing is 139 vs 321 in the first set.
There is no way these all point to the same spot with a 180' difference between these 
two readings, but the MatchedAngles column is the same for the two sets. The difference is 
in the Latitude/Longitude columns. This is Pamguard's guess at where the point is. After
the call pointing at noise (bearing 139) this guess is very different from previous guesses.
This is where Pamguard is trying to use all MatchedAngles calls to get one intersection point
using some kind of algorithm (don't know what).
