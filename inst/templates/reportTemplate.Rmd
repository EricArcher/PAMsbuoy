# `r paste0(cruiseName, ' (', cruiseAbbr, ')')` Sonobuoy Report
### `r format(Sys.time(), format='%a %b %d %Y')`


Navy surplus sonobuoys (type-53F) were deployed from the survey vessel during `r cruiseAbbr`; this report includes deployments conducted between `r format(min(detSummary$UTC), format='%b %d %Y')` and `r format(max(detSummary$UTC), format='%b %d %Y')` on the vessel(s) [name of vessel(s) used]. Sonobuoys were programmed to allow for best performance (Table 1). Sonobuoy signals were received via shipboard antenna cabled to a Winradio sonobuoy receiver (model WR-G39WSBE). Recordings were digitized at a 48 kHz sampling rate with a [soundcard specifics] and recorded to hard drive using Pamguard software (Pamguard version xxxx, Gillespie et al. 2008). 


A total of `r nrow(distinct(detSummary, Station, Buoy))` sonobuoys were deployed at `r nrow(distinct(detSummary, Station))` stations throughout the study area (Fig. 1), including [x] from [vessel #1] and [x] from [ 2] (Table 1).  Deployments included 
`r nrow(distinct(filter(detSummary, StationType=='DensityEstimate'), Station))`
sonobuoy stations and 
`r nrow(distinct(filter(detSummary, StationType=='Opportunistic'), Station, Buoy))`
sonobuoys deployed opportunistically in the presence of sighted cetaceans (Table 1).  Opportunistic sonobuoys included a total of [x] minutes of recordings during confirmed visual sightings of [x] (Table 1). Acoustic detections included species name 
`r gsub('(.* )([A-z]*)$', '\\1and \\2', paste(unique(detSummary$Species), collapse=', '))`
 (Table 2, Figure 2).
